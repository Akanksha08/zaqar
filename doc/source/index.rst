Welcome to Marconi's documentation!
===================================

Marconi is an OpenStack project to provide "Messaging as a service".

Marconi, as with all OpenStack projects, is written with the following design
guidelines in mind:

* **Component based architecture**: Quickly add new behaviors
* **Highly available**: Scale to very serious workloads
* **Fault tolerant**: Isolated processes avoid cascading failures
* **Recoverable**: Failures should be easy to diagnose, debug, and rectify
* **Open standards**: Be a reference implementation for a community-driven api

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Additional draft and project documentation on Marconi and other components of OpenStack can
be found on the `OpenStack wiki`_. Cloud administrators, refer to `docs.openstack.org`_.
